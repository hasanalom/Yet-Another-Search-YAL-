# Yet-Another-Search-YAS-
Welcome to the next gen of search.
Hello Everyone, Well, from the first day of using Google I just fall in love with it. From that day I decided to make a search engine (I know it's not very easy). Genuinely Google is doing smart but I think there has to be something different than Google that yet to be made. I welcome each and every contributors to contribute towards our project and take it to the next level.

**Basics of Search Engine**
*How Search Engine Works*
Search engines use automated software (known as robots or spiders) to follow links on Websites, harvesting information as they go. When someone submits a query to a search engine, the engine returns a list of sites, ranking them on their relevance to the keywords used in the search.
There are three pieces of software that together make up a search engine:
>The Spider Software
>The Index Software and
>The Query Software.

The spider software 'crawls the web looking for new pages to collect and add to the search engine indices'.
This is a metaphor. In reality, the spider doesn't do any 'crawling' and doesn't 'visit' any web pages. It requests pages from a website in the same way as Microsoft Explorer, or Firefox or whichever browser you use requests pages to display on your screen.
The difference is that the spider doesn't collect images or formatting - it is only interested in text and links AND the URL, (for example, http://www.Unique-Resource-Locator.html) from which they come. It doesn't display anything and it gets as much information as it can is the shortest time possible.
Since the spider doesn't collect images, it doesn't take notice of Flash intros or colorful pictures. So, make sure your images, logo or videos are identified by a text 'alt tag,' or the spider will ignore them and they will not have value in the search engines.


The index software catches everything the spider can throw at it (yes, that's another metaphor). The index makes sense of the mass of text, links and URLs using what is called an algorithm - a complex mathematical formula that indexes the words, the pairs of words and so on.
Essentially, an algorithm analyzes the pages and links for word combinations to figure out what the web pages are all about - in other words, what topics are being covered. Then, scores are assigned that allow the search engine to measure how relevant or important the web pages (and URLs) might be to the person who is searching. While each of the major search engines (like Google, Yahoo or Bing) has their own secret algorithm for scoring, they are all using the information a spider collects.
And of course the index software records all of this information and makes it available.
The spider takes the information it has gathered about a web page and sends it to the index software where it is analyzed and stored.


The query software is what you see when you go to a search engine - it is the front end of what everybody thinks of as a search engine. It may look simple but the query software presents the results of all the quite remarkable spider and index software that works away invisibly on our behalf.
So, when you type in your search words and hit search, then the search engine will try to match your words with the best, most relevant web pages it can find by 'searching the web'.
But this too is a metaphor and perhaps the most important one.
The query software doesn't actually search the web - instead, it checks through all the records that have been created by its own index software. And those records are made possible by the text, links and URL material the spider software collects.
